    Load the data
    Generate a split set with random class proportions ready for ML
    Visualize class assignment in each part of your split
    Repeat the above split and visualisation but with a proportional not random split (class distribution within the test set should mirror the train set)
    Briefly explain what proportion (e.g 70/30) and distribution approach you would prefer to use and why?
