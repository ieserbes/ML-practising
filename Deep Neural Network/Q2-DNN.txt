Tasks

    Load the data sets ['xTrain.csv','xTest.csv','yTrain.csv','yTest.csv'] Then onehot encode the labels (y), recommend:
        from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
        Also standardise the data (x)
    Finish the design for this running neural net
    Train your net with the data, output a classified set (fix the code again)
    Achieve a final accuracy of above 80% and loss under 1.1 on the training set
    Visualize net accuracy across epochs
    Vary the learning rate (perhaps using a loop), find the best rate for both training and test sets, visualize them across epochs each time
    Briefly, what do you notice? Is there a best learning rate?
